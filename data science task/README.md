Homework problem
================

The data consists of 5000 10000-dimensional numeric observations
labelled either -1 or +1. The observations are split into training and
testing data, given respectively in `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`.
The former has 3750 and the latter has 1250 observations in it. We provide
the labels for the training data in `train_labels.csv`. Your task is
to predict labels for the testing data.

Return:
-------
1. A report/notebook that explains the problem and justifies your way of
getting to the final solution. In particular, explain why you chose to
use the final solution as opposed to some alternative solutions. Your
explanation will be weighted as much as your solution in the
evaluation. Also, give your own estimate on how good this solution
is. All relevant code or plots should be appropriately referenced.

2. A clearly written .py script that generates the predictions, and is in a
format that could be a part of a cloud-deployed solution. You are free 
to use whatever tool-set you like.

3. Predictions in a file named `test_labels.csv`.

Please note:
------------
Completeness, quality and clarity of the returned results help us decide if we want to arrange next sessions with an applicant. 
If we ask you to attend the next interview session then be ready to describe and defend the problem and your solution in a form of 10 minutes presentation with a subsequent Q&A session.
